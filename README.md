# Simple Enarx-Demo
This demo shows how to deploy workloads to Trusted Execution Envroment using Enarx. In this example it is assumed that the user wants to protect both algorithm and data

The Tee is where the processing takes place, both algorithm and data remains confidential during processing as this gurantees data confidentiality, code integrity and data integrity.

In this demo the user trains a machine learining model in the TEE, the main goal of the demo is to show how to easily deploy and run workloads in the TEE using Enarx ....
